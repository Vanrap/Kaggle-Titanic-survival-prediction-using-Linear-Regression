# Kaggle-Titanic-survival-prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This repository consists of my approach to the Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction competition. 
In this competition, a data set consisting the information of passengers such as their name, sex, age ,etc. is used to 
predict what sorts of people were the most likely to survive the Titanic crash.
I have used sci kit learn to create a multiple regression machine learning model to predict the survival of a passenger.

Any changes or modifications which may make the code more efficient are always encouraged!
